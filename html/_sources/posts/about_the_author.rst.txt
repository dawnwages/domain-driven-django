Hey, I'm `Dawn Wages <www.dawnwages.info>`_ (she/her) a Python and Django Developer. I'm a co-founder of `CMD Limes, LTD <www.cmdlimes.com>`_ where we build Python and data science web applications. You may have seen me on the Python stage talking about Developer Experience, and Developer Tools. My 9-5 is as a Python Community Technical PM at Microsoft. I'm a co-creator of `Djangonaut Space <https://djangonaut.space>`_, the Django mentorship program. I also serve as Chair of the `Python Software Foundation <https://python.org>`_. 

Over the years I've worked at Python agencies and Django shops, building web apps for technical and non-technical stakeholders. I've been impressed with the zero to sixty experience with Django. It's been invaluable in abstracting away the complexities of building a moder web application. As I built more complex applications, mired in the client specifics, it's easy to lose sight of the benefits of Django and instead just try to get the application to work; sometimes just writing Python circumventing some of the nice tools Django offers. Sometimes it takes memorizing Django cover to cover to know how a new feature can help the problem in front of you. I'm excited for this new adventure as a first time author, applying some of the principles we're using at CMD Limes, LTD, to ship great products that meet the domain experts' expectations.

When I'm not writing Python, you can find me hanging with my wife and my dogs, watching Star Trek in Philly, PA, USA.
